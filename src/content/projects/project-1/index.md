The Smart Vacuum cleaner is a robot that collect the trash (base on the side of the robot) that control by human via mobile phone. This robot contain 4 wheels like a car, 1 spinner to collect the trash to the container that will contain the trash. The thing that like from this mini robot is the relay module, that allow the user can switch to turn on or turn off the spinner via mobile phone. This can help to save the power, and make it flexible when the trash is far away from each other, we turn off the spinner and turn on when it reach to the target to collect the trash. This project I finished when I study at year 1 in Rupp, ITE.
